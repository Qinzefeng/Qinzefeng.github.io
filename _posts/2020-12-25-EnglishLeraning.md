* **语法一：** 谈论即将发生但又被另一事件阻止而未发生的事件时，用 **was + going to + 动词** ，然后用 **but** 引导的过去时态分局。

		Chris was going to Kiss Hannah, but her phone rang.
		They were going to separate, but they fell in love again.

	可以用同样的方式使用 **was about to + 动词**

		The show was about to end, but they wrote three more episodes(剧集).
		The police were about to catch the murderer, **but** he ran.  

********
   
* **语法二：** 有时形容词的结尾决定了其使用放松，以 **-ing** 结尾的形容词描述的是实物，如电视节目；而以 **-ed** 结尾的形容词描述的则是人的感受。

	事物：
	
		Documentaries are boring. Let's watch something funny.
		This show is confusing. Why did he muder the baker?
		I love this action movive. It's really exciting.
		He thinks news channels are interesting. I don't.

	感受：
	
		I'm bored. Can we watch something else?
		Now I'm really confused. Is that his sister or his mother?
		Dan's excited to see the find episode of 'Live on'.
		The detective's interested in talking to the landord.
		That guy won $200,000 on 'Hozard Roll'? I'm absolutely amazed.
